## Laravel Todo App üìù‚úÖ
This is a simple Laravel project that allows you to create and manage your todos in a fun and interactive way! With this small app, you can easily add new todos, view them on the page, and mark them as completed to remove them from view.

## Features
1- Create Todos: Add new todos with a title and description to keep track of your tasks.
2- View Todos: See all your todos displayed on the page with their titles and descriptions.
3- Mark as Completed: When you've finished a task, simply mark it as completed, and it will be removed from view.

## Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/far0uq/todo-list.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd todo-list
```

- Install the dependencies using Composer.

- Configure the database settings in the .env file with your database credentials. Set the following values:
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_PORT=your_database_port
DB_DATABASE=databaseForTodos
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

- Run the database migrations to set up the required tables:
```
php artisan migrate
```

- Start the development server:
```
php artisan serve
```

- Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8000 to access the Todo App!

## Usage
- Once you access the Todo App in your browser, you will be presented with an input field and a button to save item.
- Enter a title for your todo in the provided field.
- Click on the "Save Item" button to add the todo to the list.
- Your new todo will appear at the bottom of the list.
- To mark a todo as completed and remove it from view, click on the "Mark Complete" button for that todo.
- The completed todo will disappear from the list, leaving you with a clean view of your active todos.
